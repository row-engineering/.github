## Hello 👋

We design and build the digital experience for [restofworld.org](https://restofworld.org) — supporting impactful journalism with a fast, accessible site. Our work spans design systems, frontend/backend development (WordPress, JS, PHP), analytics, and experimentation to drive engagement and growth. We collaborate closely with Editorial and Audience teams to deliver thoughtful, user-centered features.

We strive to follow modern best practices in web development and design, with an emphasis on performance, accessibility, and rapid iteration. We ship early and often, and regularly share our work and thinking on [our blog](https://restofworld.org/category/product/).

We've also open-sourced our [AI Narration WordPress plugin](https://github.com/row-engineering/ai-narration) — a tool that converts posts into audio narrations using AI text-to-speech, making content more accessible and engaging for readers.
